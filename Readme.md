This is project based on Regression to predict sales.
This project has done for Analytics Vidya.
First load data then done preprocessing steps
prepare to build model using random forest regressor(RFR)
done hyperparameter tuning with random search cv
also build model with Support vector regressor(SVR) and check value of RMSE with RFR
and RFR give less value
next build model with XGboost regressor and gradiant boost regresor also check value of RMSE with RFR
we found RFR gives less value so we go with RFR
and predict test value through RFR model.
